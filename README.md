# Face Detection and Recognition Using OpenCV in Python

This project demonstrates a face detection and recognition system using OpenCV in Python. It employs advanced computer vision techniques to identify and recognize faces in images or live video streams.

## Features
- Detects faces in images or videos using Haar cascades.
- Recognizes faces using pre-trained models.
- Real-time face recognition from webcam or video feed.
- Easy-to-use interface and customizable settings.
